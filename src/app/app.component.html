      <p>
        Paying consumer testers to go on random journeys around your site with no specific outcomes in mind? What can
        you possibly gain from such an unstructured approach? The answer is that you’ll discover behaviours and
        reactions you hadn’t even considered.</p>

      <p>User experience and reactions count when it comes to your app or website. And users seldom act systematically
        or predictably. When <a href = "#">real-life users test your website or app in the real-world environment,</a> we can record their
        initial interactions and key journeys, plus their opinions before and after testing.</p>

      <p>
        This evidence is powerful and authentic: it shows everyone from senior leaders to developers what customers
        really think and do when they use your site or app. Use the evidence to improve loyalty, dwell time and
        <a href = "#">conversions that directly impact business revenue.</a>
