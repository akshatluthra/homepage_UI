                    <p>“We chose to work with Digivante on the strength of their previous projects for other customers.
                        They
                        could really demonstrate the impact of their usability studies, showing how revenue was lost
                        because of
                        issues and the improvements after their recommendations had been implemented.”</p>

                    <p class="text-center">Usability testing can be invaluable for critiquing wireframes, helping to answer questions like“which approach to adding to a basket is better?” Testing wireframes helps your developers to build an experience that’s great for users from the very start.</p>

                    <p class="text-center">Once your site or app goes live, usability testing for the overall customer experience evaluates your site or app in its real-world context.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">When the site or app is part of the complete customer experience, you can test interactions with your business as whole. Examine every aspect, including customer service,refunds and returns, aftercare and searchability to help functions. Usability testing checks that your customer journey delivers what customers expect from your brand – from start to finish..</p>
